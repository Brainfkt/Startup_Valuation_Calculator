# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Startup Valuation Calculator?
The Startup Valuation Calculator is a comprehensive web application that helps entrepreneurs, investors, and analysts calculate startup valuations using six different professional methodologies. It provides interactive charts, detailed analysis, and professional PDF reports.

### Who should use this tool?
- **Entrepreneurs**: Preparing for fundraising or understanding company value
- **Angel Investors**: Evaluating early-stage investment opportunities
- **Venture Capitalists**: Conducting due diligence and investment analysis
- **Business Students**: Learning valuation methodologies
- **Financial Analysts**: Performing startup valuations for clients

### Is this tool suitable for all types of companies?
The tool is specifically designed for startups and early-stage companies. Different methods are appropriate for different stages:
- Pre-revenue: Berkus Method, Scorecard Method
- Early revenue: DCF, Scorecard Method
- Growth stage: DCF, Market Multiples, VC Method
- Established companies: DCF, Market Multiples

## Methodology Questions

### Which valuation method should I use?
The choice depends on your company's stage and available data:
- **DCF**: Best for companies with predictable cash flows and financial history
- **Market Multiples**: When comparable companies exist in your industry
- **Scorecard**: Early-stage startups with limited financial data
- **Berkus**: Pre-revenue startups (maximum $2.5M valuation)
- **Risk Factor**: Secondary method for risk adjustment
- **VC Method**: Investment scenarios with clear exit strategies

### Can I use multiple methods together?
Yes, using multiple methods is strongly recommended. This provides validation and helps establish a valuation range rather than a single point estimate. Most professional valuations use 2-3 methods for comparison.

### How accurate are these valuations?
Valuations are estimates based on assumptions about future performance. Accuracy depends on:
- Quality of input data
- Realism of assumptions
- Current market conditions
- Company-specific factors

Use results as starting points for analysis and decision-making, not as definitive statements of value.

### What's the difference between pre-money and post-money valuation?
- **Pre-money valuation**: Company value before investment
- **Post-money valuation**: Company value after investment
- Formula: Post-money = Pre-money + Investment amount

The VC Method can calculate both when investment amount is provided.

## Technical Questions

### What data do I need to prepare?
Required data varies by method:

**DCF Method**:
- Historical financial statements
- Cash flow projections (3-10 years)
- Industry discount rates
- Growth assumptions

**Market Multiples**:
- Current financial metrics (revenue, EBITDA)
- Industry comparable data
- Recent transaction multiples

**Scorecard Method**:
- Regional market data for base valuation
- Objective assessment of company strengths/weaknesses

### How do I get industry multiples?
Sources for industry multiples:
- Financial databases (Capital IQ, PitchBook)
- Industry reports and research
- Recent transaction announcements
- Public company filings
- Investment banking research

### What if I don't have historical financial data?
For companies without financial history:
- Use Berkus Method (pre-revenue focus)
- Use Scorecard Method (qualitative assessment)
- Create realistic financial projections for DCF
- Focus on comparable company analysis

### How often should I update valuations?
Recommended update frequency:
- **Quarterly**: For active fundraising
- **Semi-annually**: For general business planning

## Input and Validation Questions

### Why am I getting validation errors?
Common validation errors and solutions:

**"Discount rate must be higher than terminal growth rate"**
- Increase discount rate or decrease terminal growth
- Typical spread should be at least 2-3%

**"Value must be a valid number"**
- Remove currency symbols and text
- Use numbers only (e.g., 1000000 not â‚¬1M)

**"Very large value detected"**
- Check input units (thousands vs millions)
- Verify realistic order of magnitude

### What are reasonable ranges for key inputs?
**Discount Rates**:
- Early-stage startups: 25-50%
- Growth companies: 15-25%
- Established companies: 8-15%

**Terminal Growth Rates**:
- Conservative: 0-2%
- GDP growth: 2-3%
- High growth markets: 3-5%

**Industry Multiples**:
- Technology: 4-15x revenue
- Healthcare: 3-8x revenue
- Consumer: 1-5x revenue
- Services: 2-6x revenue

### How do I handle negative cash flows?
Negative cash flows are common in early-stage companies:
- Include them in DCF projections
- Ensure eventual positive cash flows
