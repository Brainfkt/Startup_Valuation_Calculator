  - Different sectors and metric types
  - Edge cases (zero values, high multiples)
  - Invalid input validation (negative values)

- **Scorecard Method**
  - Weighted scoring calculations
  - Perfect and poor score scenarios
  - Custom weight handling
  - Input validation (score ranges, base valuation)

- **Berkus Method**
  - Five-criteria evaluation
  - Maximum and minimum score scenarios
  - Missing criteria detection
  - Score range validation

### Additional Test Categories

  - Error handling across methods
  - Data consistency checks

## Running Tests

### From Web Interface
1. Navigate to the main application
2. Click "Run Test Suite" in the sidebar
3. Choose "Run All Tests" for comprehensive testing
4. Choose "Quick Test" for essential validation
5. View results with detailed metrics and error reporting

### From Command Line
```bash
python test_suite.py
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Metrics
- **Total Tests**: Number of individual test cases executed
- **Passed**: Tests that completed successfully
- **Failed**: Tests that didn't meet expected outcomes
- **Errors**: Tests that encountered execution problems
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of passing tests

### Status Indicators
- **All Passed**: System ready for production use
- **Some Failed**: Review issues before deployment
- **Critical Errors**: Immediate attention required

### Detailed Error Analysis
Failed tests include:
- Specific test method name
- Complete error traceback
- Expected vs actual results
- Recommendations for fixes

## Test Data and Scenarios

### DCF Test Scenarios
```python
# Basic scenario
cash_flows = [100000, 120000, 144000, 172800, 207360]
discount_rate = 0.12
terminal_growth = 0.03

# Edge case - zero flows
cash_flows = [0, 0, 0]

# Invalid case - negative rate
discount_rate = -0.05
```

### Market Multiples Scenarios
```python
# Technology sector
revenue = 1000000
multiple = 5.0
sector = "Technology"

# Invalid case
revenue = -1000000  # Should fail
```

### Scorecard Test Data
```python
# Balanced scores
criteria_scores = {
    "team": 4,
    "product": 3,
    "market": 5,
    "competition": 3,
    "financial": 4,
    "legal": 2
}
base_valuation = 2000000
```

### Berkus Test Cases
```python
# Complete evaluation
criteria_scores = {
    "concept": 3,
    "prototype": 4,
    "team": 3,
    "strategic_relationships": 2,
    "product_rollout": 1
}
```

## Error Handling Validation

### Input Validation Tests
- Negative values where inappropriate
- Out-of-range scores (0-5 scale)
- Missing required parameters
- Invalid data types

### Calculation Error Tests
- Division by zero scenarios
- Mathematical overflow/underflow
- Invalid rate combinations
- Empty data sets

### Integration Error Tests
- Method interaction failures
- Data persistence issues
- State management problems

## Continuous Testing Benefits

### Quality Assurance
- Validates all calculations before user interaction
- Ensures consistent behavior across methods
- Identifies regressions during updates

### Reliability Verification
- Tests edge cases users might encounter
- Validates error handling mechanisms
- Confirms mathematical accuracy

### Development Confidence
- Safe refactoring with test coverage
- Automated validation of new features
- Consistent behavior documentation

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test methods in appropriate test class
2. Follow naming convention: `test_[feature]_[scenario]`
3. Include assertions for expected behavior
4. Test both success and failure cases

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Modify test expectations when functionality changes
2. Ensure backward compatibility validation
3. Update test data for new scenarios
4. Maintain comprehensive coverage

### Test Data Management
- Use realistic financial scenarios
- Include boundary conditions
- Test with various scales (startup to enterprise)
- Validate international considerations

## Performance Testing

### Execution Speed
- Individual test execution time
- Complete suite completion time
- Memory usage during testing
- Concurrent test execution

### Scalability Testing
- Large dataset handling
- Multiple calculation scenarios
- Memory efficiency validation
- Processing time optimization

## Security Testing

### Input Sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting protection
- Input validation bypass attempts
- Buffer overflow protection

### Data Protection
- Sensitive calculation data handling
- Memory cleanup after tests
- Temporary file management
- Error message information leakage

## Reporting and Documentation

### Test Reports
- Execution summary statistics
- Detailed failure analysis
- Performance metrics
- Coverage analysis

### Export Functionality
- Text-based test reports
- Structured data exports
- Historical test result tracking

## Best Practices

### Test Design
- Single responsibility per test
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Independent test execution
- Comprehensive assertion coverage

### Data Management
- Use representative test data
- Avoid hardcoded values when possible
- Test boundary conditions
- Include realistic scenarios

### Maintenance
- Regular test suite execution
- Update tests with feature changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Import path problems: Ensure all modules are accessible
- Test data conflicts: Use isolated test scenarios
- Assertion failures: Verify expected vs actual behavior
- Performance degradation: Monitor test execution times

### Resolution Steps
1. Check error messages and tracebacks
2. Verify test data validity
3. Confirm method signatures match
4. Review recent code changes
5. Run individual tests for isolation

This comprehensive testing suite ensures the startup valuation calculator maintains high quality, reliability, and accuracy across all supported valuation methods.
